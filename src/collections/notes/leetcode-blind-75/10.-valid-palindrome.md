# 10. Valid Palindrome

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

Note: Alphanumeric characters consist of letters (`A-Z`, `a-z`) and numbers (`0-9`).

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        left = 0 # Pointer from the start of the string
        right = len(s) - 1 # Pointer from the end of the string

        while left < right: # While our pointers have not met yet
            while left < right and not s[left].isalnum(): # Left pointer skip all non-alphanumeric characters (without going over right pointer)
                left += 1
            while right > left and not s[right].isalnum(): # Right pointer skip all non-alphanumeric characters (without going over left pointer)
                right -= 1

            if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower(): # Case insensitive matching, early exit if not matching
                return False

            left += 1 # Continue
            right -= 1

        return True
```

For a string `s` of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
- Space complexity: $O(1)$
