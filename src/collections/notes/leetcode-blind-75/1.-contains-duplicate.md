# 1. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return `false`.

# Solution

We can check whether the length of the set of `nums` is equal to `nums`:

```py
class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        return len(set(nums)) != len(nums)
```

Or, we can use a `set` to store the seen numbers, and as we go through `nums`, we add the number to the set. If we have seen the current number (the current number is in the set), then we have a duplicate.

```py
class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                return True

            seen.add(num)

        return False
```

For an array of $N$ numbers:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$
