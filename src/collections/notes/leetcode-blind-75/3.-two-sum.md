# 3. Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] == target` and `i != j`.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first. 

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {} # { [number]: index }

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if target - nums[i] in seen: # Found x + num == target
                # seen[target - nums[i]] is the smaller index, because we have already seen it before the current number
                return [seen[target - nums[i]], i] 

            seen[nums[i]] = i

        return [-1, -1]
```

For `nums` with $N$ numbers:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$
