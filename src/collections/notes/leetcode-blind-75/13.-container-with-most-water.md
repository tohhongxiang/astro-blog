# 13. Container With Most Water

https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/

You are given an integer array `heights` where` heights[i]` represents the height of the `i`-th bar.

You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Key insight: We have 2 pointers, starting from the start and the end of the `heights` array. This gives us the widest container. The height is limited by the shorter line, so to potentially increase the area, we must **move the pointer at the shorter line inward**. Moving the taller line does not help, because it keeps the height the same, but reduces the width.

```py
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(heights) - 1

        result = 0
        while left < right:
            result = max(result, (right - left) * min(heights[left], heights[right]))
            if heights[left] < heights[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return result
```

For a list of $N$ `heights`:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$ to traverse through the entire `heights` array
- Space complexity: $O(1)$
