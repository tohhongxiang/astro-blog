# 4. Group Anagrams

# Solution

Key point: We can use an array of `count` to be the key for each word. For 2 words, if they are anagram, they will have the same `count` array.

1. Initialize `result` to be a dictionary, where the key is the "anagram key" (count), and the value is the list of anagrams.
2. Go through each string in `strs`, and compute the `count` array.
3. Add the word to `result` based on the `count` as the key.
4. Return the list of anagrams

```py
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        result = defaultdict(list) # { [charCount]: anagram[] }

        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for char in s:
                count[ord(char) - ord("a")] += 1

            result[tuple(count)].append(s)

        return list(result.values())
```

For `strs` of length $N$, and each string in `strs` having an average length of $M$:
- Time complexity: $O(MN)$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$ for `result`, and $O(MN)$ for the output list
