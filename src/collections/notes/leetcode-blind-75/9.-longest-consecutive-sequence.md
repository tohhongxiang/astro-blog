# 9. Longest Consecutive Sequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/

Given an array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.

A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ time.

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums) # We do not care about duplicates
        longest = 0 # Track the longest consecutive sequence

        for num in nums: # Go through each number
            if num - 1 not in nums: # Only process numbers that should be in the start of a range
                length = 1 # The initial range only contains the number itself
                while num + length in nums: # While there are consecutive numbers within the array
                    length += 1 # Update the length

                longest = max(longest, length) # Update the longest sequence we have

        return longest
```

For a list of $N$ `nums`:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$ for traversing through the array
- Space complexity: $O(N)$ extra space for `set(nums)`
