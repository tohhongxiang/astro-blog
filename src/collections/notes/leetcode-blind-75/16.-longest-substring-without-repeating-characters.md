# 16. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

# Solution

## Solution 1: Sliding Window

Key insight: We keep expanding the string as much as we can. However, when we see a duplicate character, we shrink the window by moving the left pointer inwards, until we do not have that character anymore.

```py
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        seen = set()
        left = 0
        result = 0

        for right in range(len(s)):
            while s[right] in seen:
                seen.remove(s[left])
                left += 1

            seen.add(s[right])
            result = max(result, right - left + 1)

        return result
```

For a string of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$

## Solution 2: Sliding Window (Optimal)

Key insight: We store each character's last seen index in a map `last_index`. When we meet the character again, we can move the left pointer to 1 after the last index we saw. We also make sure we are not moving the left pointer backwards.

```py
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        last_index = {}
        left = 0
        result = 0

        for right in range(len(s)):
            if s[right] in last_index:
                left = max(last_index[s[right]] + 1, left)

            last_index[s[right]] = right
            result = max(result, right - left + 1)

        return result
```

For a string of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$
