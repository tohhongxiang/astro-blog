# 49. Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Search Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/submissions/1896719821/

Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are unique, and two nodes from the tree `p` and `q`, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor between two nodes `p` and `q` is the lowest node in a tree `T` such that both `p` and `q` as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a descendant of itself.

# Solution

## Solution 1: Recursion DFS

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root or not p or not q:
            return None

        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)

        if p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        return root
```

For a tree of $N$ nodes, and a height $H$:
- Time complexity: $O(H)$
- Space complexity: $O(H)$

## Solution 2: Iteration DFS

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        current = root
        while current:
            if p.val > current.val and q.val > current.val:
                current = current.right
            elif p.val < current.val and q.val < current.val:
                current = current.left
            else:
                return current

        return None
```

- Time complexity: $O(H)$
- Space complexity: $O(1)$
