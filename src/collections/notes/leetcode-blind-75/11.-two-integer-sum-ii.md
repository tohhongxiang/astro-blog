# 11. Two Integer Sum II

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/

Given an array of integers `numbers` that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return the indices (1-indexed) of two numbers, `[index1, index2]`, such that they add up to a given target number `target` and `index1 < index2`. Note that `index1` and `index2` cannot be equal, therefore you may not use the same element twice.

There will always be exactly one valid solution.

Your solution must use $O(1)$ additional space.

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left = 0
        right = len(numbers) - 1

        while left < right:
            current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            if current_sum == target: # Reached target
                return [left + 1, right + 1]

            if current_sum < target: # Sum too small, increase left pointer
                left += 1
            else: # Sum too big, decrease right pointer
                right -= 1

        return [-1, -1]
```

For a list of $N$ `numbers`:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
- Space complexity: $O(1)$
