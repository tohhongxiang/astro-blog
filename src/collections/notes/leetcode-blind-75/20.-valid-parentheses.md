# 20. Valid Parentheses

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/

You are given a string `s` consisting of the following characters: `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`.

The input string `s` is valid if and only if:

1. Every open bracket is closed by the same type of close bracket.
2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Return `true` if `s` is a valid string, and `false` otherwise.

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        matching_brackets = { ")": "(", "]": "[", "}": "{" }
        for c in s:
            if c in matching_brackets:
                if len(stack) > 0 and stack[-1] == matching_brackets[c]:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                stack.append(c)

        return len(stack) == 0
```

For a string `s` of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$
