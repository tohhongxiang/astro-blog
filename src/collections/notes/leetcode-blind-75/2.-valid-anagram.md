# 2. Valid Anagram

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
            
        count_s = Counter(s)
        count_t = Counter(t)

        for letter, frequency in count_s.items():
            if count_t[letter] != frequency:
                return False

        return True
```

For `s` of length $M$, and `t` of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N + M)$
- Space complexity: $O(N + M)$
